# Design Document: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for DocuFlex Language

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed design specification for the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the DocuFlex Domain Specific Language. The AST serves as a crucial component in the language's implementation, enabling efficient processing and representation of the hierarchical structure of DocuFlex source code. This document outlines the key design decisions, structures, and functionalities of the AST, with the aim of simplifying its implementation and ensuring optimal performance.

## 2. AST Structure

The AST for the DocuFlex language consists of a hierarchical tree structure that captures the organization and relationships of the various components within the source code. The tree structure is composed of distinct nodes representing different language constructs, such as documents, blocks, metadata, statements, expressions, and other relevant entities. The following are the core node types within the AST:

1. **DocumentNode**: Represents a DocuFlex document, which serves as the highest-level container for the language constructs. It contains child nodes representing the blocks and other elements within the document.

2. **BlockNode**: Represents a block within a document, which can be a section, subsection, or any other defined organizational unit. Block nodes may contain child nodes representing nested blocks, metadata, and statements.

3. **MetadataNode**: Represents metadata associated with a block or document. Metadata nodes store information such as titles, descriptions, tags, or any other relevant attributes.

4. **StatementNode**: Represents a statement within a block, encapsulating actions or operations to be performed. Statement nodes may include expressions, function calls, assignments, or other executable elements.

5. **ExpressionNode**: Represents an expression within a statement, capturing computations, evaluations, or other operations. Expression nodes may involve variables, literals, operators, or function calls.

## 3. AST Functionality

The AST provides various functionalities that facilitate the processing and manipulation of DocuFlex source code. These functionalities include:

1. **Construction and Parsing**: The AST is constructed by parsing the input source code using a lexer and a parser. The parser analyzes the token stream generated by the lexer and constructs the AST by recognizing the grammar and syntax of the DocuFlex language.

2. **Validation and Semantic Analysis**: The AST facilitates semantic analysis by verifying the correctness and adherence of the source code to the language's semantics. This includes checks for variable declarations, type compatibility, scope resolution, and other semantic rules specific to the DocuFlex language.

3. **Traversing and Transforming**: The AST allows for efficient traversal of the tree structure, enabling operations such as searching for specific nodes, extracting information, or performing transformations on the code. Traversing the AST is useful for implementing static analysis, code generation, or other advanced processing tasks.

4. **Execution and Interpretation**: The AST serves as the input for the interpreter or compiler, allowing the execution of the corresponding actions specified by the DocuFlex source code. The interpreter/compiler traverses the AST and performs the necessary operations, such as generating documentation files, extracting data, or populating documents with content based on the AST structure.

## 4. Design Considerations

When implementing the AST, consider the following design considerations:

1. **Modularity**: Design the AST in a modular manner, allowing for easy extensibility and maintenance. Each node type should encapsulate its specific functionality, promoting separation of concerns and code clarity.

2. **Efficient Representation**: Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the representation and manipulation of the AST. Consider memory efficiency, node linking mechanisms, and strategies for handling large or complex AST
