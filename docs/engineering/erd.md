# DocuFlex Language Software Requirements

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the specifications and functionalities of the DocuFlex language software. The software aims to provide a light language that can be used to programmatically create software documentation following the Grand Unified Theory of Documentation. This document will define the requirements for the software, including its features, user interactions, and system behavior.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Commenting

The software must support the use of the `// @df` prefix to differentiate DocuFlex comments from regular comments in the source code. The interpreter should parse the content following this prefix as DocuFlex documentation.

### 2.2 Defining Classes

2.2.1 The software should allow users to define classes using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and its properties enclosed in curly brackets `{}`.

2.2.2 Each class definition should be identified by the `// @df` prefix.

### 2.3 Inheritance

2.3.1 The software should support the creation of classes that inherit properties from parent classes using the `extends` keyword, followed by the name of the parent class.

2.3.2 Child classes should inherit all properties from their parent classes.

### 2.4 Arrays

2.4.1 The software must enable users to define arrays of values using square brackets `[]`.

2.4.2 Arrays should be supported as property values within class definitions.

2.4.3 The software should handle nested arrays, allowing arrays to contain other arrays as elements.

### 2.5 Objects

2.5.1 The software should allow users to define objects using curly brackets `{}`.

2.5.2 Objects should be supported as property values within class definitions.

2.5.3 The software should handle nested objects, allowing objects to contain other objects as properties.

### 2.6 Multiline Strings

2.6.1 The software must support the definition of multiline strings using triple double quotes `"""`.

2.6.2 Multiline strings should be allowed as property values within class definitions.

### 2.7 Calling Information at Generation Time

2.7.1 The software should provide functionality to call information at documentation generation time from other sources, such as code bases.

2.7.2 The software should support extracting relevant information by recognizing designated markers, such as `// @df`, within the code.

2.7.3 The extracted information should be accessible during the generation of documentation and used to populate or enhance the generated documentation.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements

### 3.1 Usability

3.1.1 The software should have a user-friendly interface and provide clear and concise error messages.

3.1.2 The documentation generated by the software should follow the Grand Unified Theory of Documentation principles and be easy to read and understand.

### 3.2 Performance

3.2.1 The software should be efficient in parsing and interpreting DocuFlex code, providing fast response times.

### 3.3 Extensibility

3.3.1 The software should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements and the addition of new features.

3.3.2 The software architecture should support modular components to facilitate future extensions.

## 4. Constraints

### 4.1 Language Compatibility

4.1.1 The software should be compatible with common programming languages to allow seamless integration into existing software projects.

4.1.2 The supported programming languages should be clearly defined in the software documentation.

## 5. Documentation

### 5.1 User Guide

5.1.1 The software should provide a comprehensive user guide to aid the user with any confusion that may arise when using the language.

5.1.2 The user guide should be organized in a logical and intuitive manner, with topics arranged in a meaningful and easy-to-follow order.

5.1.3 The user guide should cover all aspects of DocuFlex, including installation, configuration, syntax, data representation, extensibility, and integration.

5.1.4 The user guide should use clear and concise language that is easy to understand for technical and non-technical users alike.

5.1.5 The user guide should include relevant examples and code snippets to illustrate key concepts and help users understand how to use DocuFlex.

5.1.6 The user guide should include cross-referencing to related topics, making it easy for users to find additional information on related concepts and features.

5.1.7 The user guide should include a search function that allows users to quickly find the information they need.

5.1.8 The user guide should include relevant images and diagrams to help users visualize and understand complex concepts.

5.1.9 The user guide should be kept up-to-date with the latest version of DocuFlex and reflect any changes or updates to the language.

5.1.10 The user guide should include a feedback mechanism that allows users to provide comments and suggestions for improving the guide.

5.1.11 The user guide should be designed to be accessible to all users, including those with visual or hearing impairments, by including alt text for images and captioning for videos.

5.1.12 The user guide should be localized to support multiple languages and ensure that users from around the world can access and understand the information.

5.1.13 The user guide should include versioning information so that users can quickly identify if they are looking at the correct documentation for the version of DocuFlex they are using.
