# Next Steps: Roadmap for DocuFlex Domain Specific Language

1. Define the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):
   - Design a comprehensive tree-based representation that accurately captures the hierarchical structure of DocuFlex source code, encompassing elements such as documents, blocks, metadata, and other components unique to the DocuFlex language. This will serve as the foundation for subsequent stages of the language implementation.

2. Create a Lexer:
   - Develop a lexer or tokenizer responsible for effectively dividing the input source code into meaningful tokens. The lexer should efficiently recognize and categorize keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals present in the DocuFlex source code, producing a stream of tokens that will be utilized by the subsequent stages of the language processing pipeline.

3. Create a Parser:
   - Build a robust parser that processes the token stream generated by the lexer. The parser should be equipped with a deep understanding of the grammar specific to the DocuFlex language, enabling it to validate the syntax and structure of the source code. The output of this stage should be an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that faithfully represents the hierarchical structure of the DocuFlex document.

4. Implement Semantic Analysis:
   - Perform thorough semantic analysis on the constructed AST to ensure its correctness and adherence to the intended semantics of the DocuFlex language. This stage involves conducting various checks, such as verifying the declaration and usage of variables, detecting type mismatches, and enforcing any required constraints or validation rules. By detecting and reporting semantic issues, this analysis phase aids in improving the reliability and accuracy of the DocuFlex programs.

5. Implement the Interpreter or Compiler:
   - Develop a capable interpreter or compiler that operates on the validated AST. The interpreter/compiler should interpret the actions specified by the AST, enabling the execution of corresponding operations such as generating comprehensive documentation files, performing data extraction or transformation, and populating documents with appropriate content based on the provided DocuFlex source code. Additionally, the interpreter/compiler should incorporate essential language features such as built-in functions, custom lambdas, and other specified constructs, enhancing the expressiveness and utility of the DocuFlex language.

6. Generate the Desired Documentation Files or Perform Intended Operations:
   - Utilize the interpreter/compiler to generate the desired documentation files based on the DocuFlex source code. The interpreter/compiler should execute the actions specified in the AST, ensuring accurate generation of documentation, data manipulation, or any other intended operations. This final stage brings the functionality and purpose of the DocuFlex language to fruition, enabling users to effectively leverage its capabilities for generating high-quality documentation or performing complex data-related tasks.

By following this roadmap, we aim to establish a robust foundation for the DocuFlex Domain Specific Language, enabling developers to leverage its expressive power and streamlined syntax for efficient documentation generation.
